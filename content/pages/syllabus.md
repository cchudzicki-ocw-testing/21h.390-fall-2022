### Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 1 session / week; 3 hours / session

### Prerequisites

Two History subjects or permission of the instructor.

### Course Overview

This class has two aims: to introduce students to methods and approaches commonly used in the scholarly study of history, and to give students the opportunity to develop a major historical essay based on primary sources. Historians do a lot of things in a lot of different ways, and so will we. We will study an array of topics across time and space as well as the distinctive ways in which historians of different parts of the world have approached the task of writing history. We will explore a number of different methodologies, such as political, social, economic, cultural, and popular histories. We will also consider a variety of sources (archival documents, oral sources, film, fiction, diaries, objects, and images) and the ways they can be used to research, interpret, and present the past.
